# mock-venmo-backend-dev
A mock Venmo-style P2P payment app using Flask, SQL, and a Sqlite3 database

I have created a Venmo-style peer-to-peer payment app where users can simply send imaginary money to each other. I have used the Flask framework to set up routes and respond to network requests. I have implemented a series of routes where one can send get, post, and delete requests to create and delete their account, create a transaction, etc.

I have connected to a Sqlite3 database file to store information about users, and have used SQL commands to interact with my created table in the database.

I have also used the API platform Postman to test my routes by sending requests to my API. I have attached my collection of Postman tests, with my request bodies typed in for POST requests.
